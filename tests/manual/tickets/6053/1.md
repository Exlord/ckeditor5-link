# Issue [#6053](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6053) manual test.

## The gravity of the selection should be changed in some cases after the link was pasted

1. Copy a part of a link in the content.
2. Paste it a paragraph.

**Expected**: The link should be pasted but you should be able to type unlinked text (the gravity overridden to the right) right away.

1. Try copying and pasting links in different places:
	1. In the middle of another link.
	2. At the beginning/end of another link
	3. Using links with different URLs.
	4. When the selection gravity is already overridden at the boundary of an existing link (use arrow left and right keys).

**Expected**: If a pasted link is not followed by another link, you should always be able to type unlinked text right away after pasting (the selection **should not** stick to the pasted link).

**Tip**: If not sure, check the Model/Selection tab in the inspector and look for the `isGravityOverridden` property.
